# Progress Report 1
I know that I should have more to show for this progress report, but I'm still figuring out how to use pdf text extractor libraries on Cyrillic text.

So far, I have gotten access to electronic versions of two of the textbooks in the series that I'm using and I'm very nearly done digitizing the last.

I've included the beginning of the jupyter notebook that I'm making for the project that shows how I'm fiddling around with libraries like PyPDF2 and pdfminer. Like I said, I still need to take some time to figure out how to use them with Cyrillic and I want to see what form the data gets output as.

I'll definitely have more to show and better results at the next check-in.

I've also downloaded a subset of the Russian National corpus, but I found another corpus of that is twice the size as of the RNC at 2 million words. There is one that's even larger that uses livejournal, facebook, twitter, and vkontakte texts but I wonder whether that will be as representative of the language like the RNC...

Food for thought as I continue
