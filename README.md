For my project I'll be exploring the vocabulary from Beginner's Russian and Russian from Intermediate to Advanced by Kagan, Kudyma and Miller. By comparing their glossaries of active vocabulary to a frequency dictionary developed from the Russian National Corpus, I hope to explore what proportion of vocabulary being targeted is useful for student, as a measure of its frequency reflected in the native Russian Corpus.
